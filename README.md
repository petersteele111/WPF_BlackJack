# WPF_BlackJack
This is a WPF application that I built for a class project. It uses a slightly modifed n-tier design and MVVM approach. It is my first WPF app and I am quite thrilled with how it turned out. There are additional features I would like to add to the program, but time constraints have made it so I leave off here for the time being. I will be adding in things like turning the sound on and off, working out a couple small bugs I found with testing, and adding in things like insurance and splitting. This was a labor of love and took a fair amount of time to put together, and I couldn't be happier with how it came out. I do want to also work on getting the screen back up to the original size I had it so the image for the table doent look so smushed. Sadly the computer screens we use at school are a square aspect ratio and not super large, so the original 1000 pixels I had it set to for the proper aspect ratio of the game board image would not fit on the schools display. Anyways, I hope you enjoy the project, and can improve upon it. It is released under GNU v 3.0 and is free to modify or distribute, should you wish to do so.
